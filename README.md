# Play_Store_App_Review_Analysis-EDA-AB
In this EDA project, my main objective is to thoroughly analyze two datasets: the "Play Store Dataset" and the "User Review Dataset." By examining various aspects of the data, such as its structure, duplicates, missing values, variables, and relationships, I aim to gain a deep understanding and uncover valuable insights. Additionally, I utilized data wrangling techniques to ensure the data is ready for analysis, and employed data visualization methods to effectively communicate my findings.

To begin, I explored the basic characteristics of the datasets, such as their size and complexity. By determining the number of rows and columns in each dataset, I can better plan and organize my analysis.

Next, I addressed the issue of duplicate values. Duplicates can distort the accuracy of the analysis, so it is crucial to identify and handle them appropriately. By carefully examining the data, I removed any duplicate entries, ensuring that my insights are based on reliable information.

Missing values can also impact the integrity of the analysis. To mitigate this, I thoroughly investigated the datasets for missing values and employ techniques like imputation or exclusion to handle them. This step will help to ensure that the analysis is based on complete and representative data.

Understanding the variables is an essential aspect of the analysis process. By examining their data types, distributions, and relationships, I can gain insights into the nature of the data and uncover potential patterns or correlations.

Since both datasets share a common column, "App," I merged them to create a unified dataset. This integration will allow me to explore a wider range of variables and derive more comprehensive insights.

Data wrangling is a crucial step to ensure the data is clean and prepared for analysis. I performed necessary transformations, such as cleaning and reformatting the data, and derive new variables if needed. This process will enhance the quality and suitability of the data for further analysis.

Data visualization played a significant role in this project. By creating various charts, plots, and graphs, I visually represented the data to identify relationships between variables and uncover meaningful patterns or trends. This enabled me to effectively communicate my findings and tell a compelling story based on the data.
